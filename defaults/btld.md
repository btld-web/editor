# Design: btld-open, btld-json, btld-form

This would be a suite of tiny web components that try to be interoperable to create large range of simple components without js. 

`Tabs`, `Expands`, `Tooltips`, `Dropdowns`, `Sidemenu`, `Bottom-Menu`, `Nested-Menu`

## Motivation

These components would usualy be throw away code or large component frameworks. Personally I have implemented these types of components for multiple projects - mostly without much thought and therefore often sub par.
